yardwaste-or-recycle (yor)
==========================

**Yor!** 

I'm sick and tired of coming home, then walking to the back of the house to put out the garbage and not remembering if it is recycle or yard waste day. Hoping to fix that with a simple and beautiful app. Will start by scraping data provide by puget sound utilities. They kind of have a JSON interface but it's not a published API. 

Keeping things simple and local to the areas served by Seattle Public Utilities for now. This is because that's where I live and the only data feed I've looked into for now.

Features
--------

- User must be prompted to enter their PSU account number on initial launch
- After initial ocnfiguration, it simply shows the next collection day and whether it's yardwaste or recycle
- User can go back and update their account number at any time.

That's all for now.
