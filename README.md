yardwaste-or-recycle
====================

I'm sick and tired of coming home, then walking to the back of the house to put out the garbage and not remembering if it is recycle or yard waste day. Hoping to fix that with a simple and beautiful app. Will start by scraping data provide by puget sound utilities. They kind of have a JSON interface but it's not a published API.
